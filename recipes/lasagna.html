        <p><h2 class="mainheader">Description</h2></p>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian flavor â€” try this homemade lasagna recipe today!</p>
