            <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

        <h2 class="mainheader">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Whisk 1 cup flour, yeast, and sugar together in a bowl. Stir in water and softened butter until well combined. Let stand until bubbles begin to form, about 15 minutes..</li>
            <li>Stir salt into yeast mixture, then gradually stir in 2 1/2 cups flour until dough can be picked up in a ball.</li>
            <li>Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes, adding more flour if needed</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 6 pieces and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll one piece into a 15-inch rope, then loop and twist rope into a pretzel shape. Place onto a baking sheet and form remaining pretzels. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Dip pretzels into the water bath for about 45 seconds, flipping over about halfway through.</li>
            <li>Transfer soaked pretzels to the prepared baking sheet; brush with melted butter and sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
